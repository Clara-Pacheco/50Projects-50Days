Many people jump into a frontend framework too early. Learning vanilla JavaScript and understanding how the document object model works are essential before moving to a framework. Practicing by coding those projects teaches you this by creating real-world projects of all types.

You will also learn more about HTML5 and CSS including semantic tags in your markup, basic CSS properties such as colors, alignment, flexbox, and shadows as well as creating responsive layouts with CSS media queries, CSS custom properties, animations/transitions, and more.

50 projects may seem like a lot, but they are small enough and it is possible to complete a project in just a few hours. Of course, this depends on your skill level.

## 🧪 Skills developed by project based learning

- Modern styling with flexbox,
- CSS animations,
- custom properties,
- DOM manipulation,
- events,
- array methods,
- HTTP requests
- & more
