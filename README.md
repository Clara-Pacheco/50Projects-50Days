# üíª 50 Projects In 50 Days - HTML, CSS & JavaScript
<br>

This repository includes 50 mini projects in HTML, CSS & JavaScript that relate to the DOM (Document Object Model) to sharpen those skills by building 50 quick, unique & fun mini projects. Here is a list of what is create in this course:

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Expanding Cards

![preview](https://github.com/Clara-Pacheco/50projects-50days/blob/main/day1_expandingCards/video/project1_preview.gif)

So in this project, I built some expanding cards.

Basically, I styled these panels to have a background image and a heading, use Flexbox to align everything and then add a little bit of JavaScript so that when we click one of these, it changes the class to active and it then expands with a CSS transition.

JavaScript is used for the event.

Listeners will be using CSS transitions to give it the smooth through the effect.

You'll see the heading doesn't come in until the card is fully expanded as well and I¬¥m using just background images and headings, but you could make these into testimonials or FAQs or whatever it might be useful.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Progress Steps

![preview]()

So in this project, I¬¥m going to build some progress steps and you might see these in different kinds of websites with forms multi basically like multi level forms, shopping carts, things like that.

Just a progress bar that starts at one and just goes along here.

So we're not going to have any form or anything, but we'll have these buttons to control the steps.

So it starts at one.

He's got this blue outline.

If I click next, then it goes to two.

So the line we get transition goes over to two to border lights up, click next again and notice at the beginning.

Previous is disabled so there's no reason to click previous and then we can keep going.

And when we click, when we get to the last one, the next is disabled.

So we can just go back and forth.

And if we're at the end disabled, then next is disabled.

So we'll start off with the HTML style, style it with CSS and then we'll add the functionality with JavaScript.

Many people jump into a frontend framework too early. Learning vanilla JavaScript and understanding how the document object model works are essential before moving to a framework. Practicing by coding those projects teaches you this by creating real-world projects of all types.

You will also learn more about HTML5 and CSS including semantic tags in your markup, basic CSS properties such as colors, alignment, flexbox, and shadows as well as creating responsive layouts with CSS media queries, CSS custom properties, animations/transitions, and more.

50 projects may seem like a lot, but they are small enough and it is possible to complete a project in just a few hours. Of course, this depends on your skill level.
